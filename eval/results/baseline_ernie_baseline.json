This contamination is not uniform across the wafer, causing edge-localized defects at the 3 o'clock position.\n   - **Root Cause**: The contamination is concentrated at single clock position, not full ring. This suggests that the contamination is not uniformly distributed across the wafer's surface, leading to edge-localized defects.\n\n2. **Defects Concentrated at Single Clock Position**:\n   - **Cause**: Defects at the single clock position are not fully distributed.

    "predicted": "Root Cause Analysis:\n\n1. **Tool ID and Lift Pin Assembly**: The tool ID (LITH-TEL-05) and lift pin assembly (Lithium-Ion Lithium Tape) are critical components in the semiconductor process. The defect observed on the wafer edge is likely due to a misalignment or damage to these components.\n\n2. **Pattern Formation**: The triangular pattern on the wafer edge is a known defect pattern. This pattern is consistent and appears as small circular impressions with a diameter of 0.5mm. This suggests that the pattern is not uniform or consistent with the expected pattern for the tool ID and lift pin assembly.\n\n3. **Lift Pin Lifetime**: The lifts pins (Lithium-Ion Lithium Tape) have a lifespan of 8,500 hours. This indicates that the pins are likely to have been damaged or misaligned over the last few weeks. This could lead to a pattern that is inconsistent with the expected lifespan.\n\n4. **Tool ID Usage**: The tool ID is used for the lithiation process, which involves the application of a thin layer of lithium-ion electrolyte to the wafer. The lifts pins are used to lift the wafer during this process. If these pins are damaged or misaligned, it could affect the lithiation process, leading to a pattern that is inconsistent with the expected lifespan.\n\nCorrective Actions:\n\n1. **Inspect and Re-align Lifts Pins**:\n   - **Action**: Inspect the lifts pins for any signs of damage or misalignment.\n   - **Action**: Re-align the lifts pins to ensure they are in the correct orientation. This may involve using a tool to reposition the pins or adjusting the tool's alignment.\n\n2. **Re-evaluate Pattern Consistency**:\n   - **Action**: Re-evaluate the pattern consistency to ensure it is consistent with the expected pattern for the tool ID and lift pin assembly.\n   - **Action**: Check the pattern for any deviations or inconsistencies. If the pattern is inconsistent, re-evaluate the tool ID and lifts pins.\n\n3. **Upgrade Lift Pin Lifespan**:\n   - **Action**: Upgrade the lifts pins to a longer lifespan, such as 10,000 hours or more.\n   - **Action**: This will ensure that the pattern remains consistent over time.\n\n4. **Optimize Lithiation Process**:\n   - **Action**: Optimize the lithiation process to ensure the lifts pins are properly aligned and not damaged.\n   - **Action**: Adjust the lithiation parameters to ensure the pattern is consistent with the expected lifespan.\n\n5. **Monitor and Maintain Tool ID**:\n   - **Action**: Maintain the tool ID and lifts pins to ensure they are functioning correctly.\n   - **Action**: Regularly inspect the tool ID and lifts pins for any signs of wear or damage.\n\nBy addressing these root causes, the defect in the wafer edge can be resolved, and the pattern on the wafer will be consistent with the expected behavior.",

    "predicted": "Root Cause Analysis:\n\n1. **Scratches on wafer center backside**: This indicates a potential defect in the lithography process. Scratches on the wafer center backside suggest that the lithography process (such as exposure, development, or any other step in the manufacturing process) has failed to produce a uniform, clean surface.

This suggests that the defect is likely related to the lithography process rather than the wafer itself.\n\nRoot Cause Analysis for the Lot W2024-6633:\n\n- **Exposure Conditions**: The defect could be due to improper exposure times. If the exposure times are not consistent or if there are variations in exposure parameters (such as exposure duration, exposure time, or exposure angle), it could lead to scratches on the wafer center backside.\n\n- **Exposure Parameters**: The exposure parameters (such as exposure time, exposure angle, or exposure intensity) need to be optimized for the specific lithography process. If these parameters are not adjusted correctly, it could result in uneven exposure, leading to scratches on the wafer center backside.\n\n- **Post-Processing**: The defect could also be related to post-processing steps.

A tool that is not compatible with the material used in the seed layer may lead to a weak seed layer, which in turn can result in ring defects.\n\n2. **Nucleation Step**:\n   - The seed layer application in this context is not nucleating properly. The seed layer is not uniform, which can lead to a lack of nucleation sites. This can result in a weak seed layer, which in turn can lead to ring defects.\n\n3. **Seed Layer Non-Uniformity**:\n   - The seed layer application in this context is non-uniform. This can be due to factors such as uneven seeding, improper seeding depth, or inadequate seeding rate. A non-uniform seed layer can lead to a lack of uniformity in the subsequent growth of the ring defect.\n\n4. **Yield Loss**:\n   - The yield loss of 24% is a significant factor. This indicates a potential yield reduction due to the defect. The root cause here is likely related to the defect itself, which can lead to a reduction in the overall yield.\n\nCorrective Actions:\n\n1. **Re-evaluate Tool Selection**:\n   - Consider using a tool specifically designed for the material (W_PLUG) in the seed layer application. This ensures proper material handling and nucleation.\n\n2. **Improve Seed Layer Application**:\n   - Ensure that the seed layer is uniformly applied. This can be achieved by using a seed layer application method that is consistent and precise, such as a seed layer application method that follows the manufacturer's guidelines or a standardized seed layer application process.\n\n3. **Enhance Seed Layer Uniformity**:\n   - Apply additional seeding techniques to improve the uniformity of the seed layer. This could involve using a seeding roller or a seeding nozzle that is designed for uniform seeding.\n\n4. **Optimize Seed Layer Depth**:\n   - Ensure that the seed layer is applied at the correct depth to avoid over-seeding or under-seeding. This can be achieved by using a seeding depth control system or by adjusting the seeding depth based on the desired growth rate.\n\n5. **Improve Seed Layer Quality**:\n   - Ensure that the seed layer is of high quality.
