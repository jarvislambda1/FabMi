Lots processed within 4hrs of stocker entry clean at this location. 7% yield loss.\n\nProcess Context: STOCKER-03 with nitrogen purge. Purge flow recently reduced for cost savings. Affected location may correlate with reduced purge zone.",
    "output": "## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Primary Cause**: Inadequate nitrogen purge allowing oxidation in stocker\n\n**Correlation Reasoning**:\n- >8hr stocker time affected = time-dependent degradation\n- <4hr clean = short time OK\n- Purge flow reduced = inadequate protection\n- Localized defect = purge dead zone\n\n**Root Cause Determination**: Reduced nitrogen purge creates dead zone at X=15, Y=-30 where atmospheric moisture reaches wafers during extended stocker time, causing localized oxidation or contamination.\n\n## Corrective Actions\n\n1. **Purge restoration**: Restore original purge flow rate\n2. **Flow mapping**: Verify purge reaches all FOUP positions\n3. **Time limit**: Enforce <8hr stocker time until fixed\n4. **Dead zone elimination**: Optimize purge distribution\n5. **Validation**: Test extended stocker time with restored purge\n\n## Prevention Measures\n\n- Purge flow monitoring\n- Stocker time tracking with alerts\n- Change management for purge modifications\n\n**Severity**: Major\n**Yield Impact**: 7%"
